    /*
     * =====How many locators are there?
     * 8 locator.
     *
     * =====What are they?
     * id, name, className, linkText, tagName, partialLinkText, xpath, css
     *
     * =====Which one do you prefer? Why?
     * ---Ahmet's answer :
     * -First If there is an ID i use id, cause id is unique and faster
     * -If there is no id then i use name if there is a unique name
     * -I also sometime create dynamic xpath. Because some elements do not have stable attributes like id and name. And I can write xpath for any element.
     * -I sometimes even use css selector instead of xpath. But i personally use xpath more than css.
     *
     * =====What is difference between absolute xpath and relative xpath?
     * -Absolute xpath we start from the parent and go child elements one by one
     * -Absolute xpath use /
     * -Absolute xpath may easily be broken when a new element is added on the page
     * -For this reason we should never use absolute xpath. In fact, my team don't let QA's use absolute xpath.
     * --Relative xpath we don't start from parent and go child one by one. We go straight to the element
     * --Relative xpath use //
     * --Relative xpath is very reliable It doesn't easy brake, because absolute xpath doesn't dependent on other element
     * --I use absolute xpath in my framework when to locate the elements
     *
     * =====What is the difference between xpath and css selector?
     * -First xpath and css are similar. Both are helpful and there are different ways to create xpath or css
     * -Syntax is a little different.
     * --in xpath we use // and @, but in css we don't
     * --css is a little faster than xpath(way less than 1 second). xpath does navigation in the html that takes a little bit time
     * --there are more ways to write xpath. For example, dynamic xpath has contains, starts-with, ends-with functions
